#katapult:MANIFESTO

Abraham Lincoln supposedly said that "the best way to predict your future is to create it". We are by no means setting out to predicting a specific future, but we are all set onto describing one worth creating. 

Many people have thought deeply about the details and implications of the future we are trying to describe here. We don't want to repeat all these arguments here, but instead build on them or condense them and where appropriate link to them. 

The purpose of this manifesto is to describe a common objective that is worth fighting and working for and that has the potential to set us as the human race on a common path towards a great future.

We still have many challenges to solve and the most important ones are well described and packaged into a framework as the [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.globalgoals.org/) [SDGs], [but we have already shown that we know how to solve the most pressing problems humanity faced over millenia: plague, war and famine. We have not solved these completely, but the numbers show that we can, if we want.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow)

We also have created an [entirely new species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Technology_Wants) during our existence that is developing a live of its own: technology. It has helped us in not only solving the mentioned problems, but also allowing us as the human race to multiply to an extent that would consume multiple planets without the help of technology. 

During the development of this new species, it has taken over more and more of what we used to do as humans for the simple reason that technology was better at those things than us. First, it took over tasks that required phyical power, currently it is beginning to take over cognitive tasks of problem solving, known as intelligence. This will leave us as human beings with the last frontier that (currently) distinguishes us from machines: consciousness. 

We see a world in which we have used technology to solve the problems we face as humanity but also a world in which the power over the decisions made by those machines resides with humans by means of consciousness and its products: moral and ethics. 

On our way there we will have to invent a mind-machine interface to solve the problem of our limited bandwidth when communicating with machines as well as enabling us as humanity to connect our minds to a higher consciousness in order to control the actions and underlying algorithms of the machines. We will have to create new forms of governing ourselves, new forms of economic systems to answer to this entirely new world.
