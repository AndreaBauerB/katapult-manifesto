#katapult:MANIFESTO

Abraham Lincoln supposedly said that "the best way to predict your future is to create it". We are by no means setting out to predicting a specific future, but we are all set onto describing one worth creating. 

Many people have thought deeply about the details and implications of the future we are trying to describe here. We don't want to repeat all these arguments here, but instead build on them or condense them and where appropriate link to them. 

The purpose of this manifesto is to describe a common objective that is worth fighting and working for and that has the potential to set us as the human race on a common path towards a great future.

We still have many challenges to solve and the most important ones are well described and packaged into a framework as the [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.globalgoals.org/) [SDGs], [but we have already shown that we know how to solve the most pressing problems humanity faced over millenia: plague, war and famine. We have not solved these completely, but the numbers show that we can, if we want.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow)

But before we set out to describe how we see the best possible future, we need to lay the foundations by describing our underlying assumptions. 

## Assumptions

### Technology

We also have created something that could be described as an [entirely new species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Technology_Wants) that is developing a emergent properties of its own: technology. It has helped us in not only solving the mentioned problems, but also allowing us as the human race to multiply to an extent that would consume multiple planets without the help of technology. 

During the history of technology, it has taken over more and more of what we used to do as humans for the simple reason that it was better at those things than us. First, it took over tasks that required phyical power, currently it is beginning to take over cognitive tasks of problem solving, known as intelligence. This will leave us as human beings with the last frontier that (currently) distinguishes us from machines: consciousness. 

We see a world in which we have used technology to solve the problems we face as humanity but also a world in which the power over the decisions made by those machines resides with humans by means of consciousness and its products: moral and ethics. 

### Exponential growth

We believe that we will continue to be able to create exponential growth of computational perfomance. We do not expect the current computational paradigms to fulfill this, but assume that new paradigms like quantum computing will not only increase the overall performance but also help to explore entirely new ways of thinking about computation.

### Automation

We believe that everything that can be automated will be automated. We see this happening in two domains: motor-skills in the form of robots and cognitive skills in the form of artificial intelligence.

### Everything is connected

We believe that everything that can be connected, will be connected. While this is easy to imagine for machines, both hard- and software based, we also see this happening for living organism like human beings. This first happens in the form of external sensors, followed by implants.


### Trust is institutionalized

We believe that trust and selective transparency will be part of the infrastructure of a fully connected and automated world. One of the first signs of how this might work are blockchain based systems that allow to rethink collaborative ecosystems from the ground up.

### We can edit life

We believe that we will be able to modify the plan for life in living organisms and write new code for entirely new organisms. The first steps in this direction are being taken with technologies like [CrispR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR).

### Decoupling

We believe that we will not only create decoupling of time by allowing asynchronous communication over networks, but even extend this into the realm of experience and hardware by technology like virtual reality or 3D-printing.


### Energy production

We believe that energy production will be fully decentralized and the cost of energy will be close to zero or zero.


## Our Vision

## BACKLOG


On our way there we will have to invent a mind-machine interface to solve the problem of our limited bandwidth when communicating with machines as well as enabling us as humanity to connect our minds to a higher consciousness in order to control the actions and underlying algorithms of the machines. We will have to create new forms of governing ourselves, new forms of economic systems to answer to this entirely new world.
